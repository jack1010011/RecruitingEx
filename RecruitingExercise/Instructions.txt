RecruitingTest class has five tests that ensure the correct functioning of User.ExpiredSubscriptions property. Three of them are implemented already.


1. Implement the ExpiredSubscriptions property in User class. An user has a list of subscriptions, which in turn might contain expired subscriptions.
   This property must return the number of expired subscriptions that the user has. Be aware that you can do any coding you need in both the Subscription
   and the User classes to solve the exercise.

2. Implement the two remaining unit tests. For this, copy and paste the code located in any of the already existing tests. Keep in mind that you *will
   have to modify at most* two lines of code in order to make the two unit tests fulfill their purpose. The method name suggests what needs to be corrected and
   serves the purpose of instructing what the unit test is meant for.
   The already existing tests must not be modified. Assume that they are correct and will pass, provided the code you implement in User.ExpiredSubscriptions
   property is working as expected.

3. Assume that the expiration date of a subscription works similar to how credit/debit cards work (they expire the last day of the month).
   Example: a subscription has an expiration date of Jan 31, 2019. If the current date is Feb 14, 2019, this subscription is considered as expired.

4. You are allowed to ask any questions regarding the structure of the code.

5. Feel free to do any research that can be of aid to solve the exercise.
